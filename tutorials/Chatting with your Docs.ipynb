Close coordination among DoD Components and DoD OGC best protects the interests of the United States, DoD, and DoD Components. In addition, alignment on significant legal issues provides an opportunity to preserve rights, remedies, and legal strategies that otherwise may be forfeited by unilateral, uncoordinated action.\\n\\nc. Timely communication, cooperation, and coordination are critical when DoD Components or DoD OGC become aware of significant litigation managed, or expected to be managed, by the Department of Justice. DoD Components may accomplish timely communication of new significant litigation to DoD OGC by submitting an initial case report that contains all of the information referenced in Figure 1.\\n\\nd.
